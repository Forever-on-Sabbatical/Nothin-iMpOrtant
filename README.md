# Nothin-iMpOrtant

This is just a simple repository that can act as a potential resource in the future for all my files

**Introduction:**

- I am a joke. Yep, you heard it. I am a joke. Nothing much to say about myself, I code and try to get by like everyone else. This here 
is the list of languages I know. 

 * C
 * Python
 * Java
 * HMTL
 * CSS
 * JavaScript
 
 I am still a noob at a lot of things, so I am working on more on it than ever. Personally, a huge fan of music. Currently grooving on 80's rock music (Black Sabbath is really awesome!) I love to play video gamees, espically RPG ones, work out, meditate I suppose? and yeah prolly just relax like a loner...
